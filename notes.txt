    Spring Batch at the most fundamental level is a state machine.
    A job defines the flow at processing will take through those states.
    So each step represents a state within the state machine. So the job defines the list of states and how to
    transition from one state to the next.

                Step

    A step represents an independent peace of processing that makes a job. A job may have many steps.
    There are two different types of steps:

                Tasklet

    This is a single interface with a single method called execute(). And what Spring Batch does is that it runs
    a single method within a scope of a transaction. You cam put whatever code you want within that, anything
    outside of item based processing.

                Chunk

    Chunk based processing is the other type of step that is available within Spring Batch.
    A chunk based step is item based. So when we look at a chunk based step we expect to be processed items individually.
    Within this type of step there are 3 main components:

        ItemReader
        ItemProcessor (optional)
        ItemWriter

        Step 1      ->     Step 2      ->     Step 2

    ItemReader          ItemReader          ItemReader
    ItemProcessor       ItemProcessor       ItemProcessor
    ItemWriter          ItemWriter          ItemWriter

    First, Step1 will start and finish, then Step2 will start and finish, ...

                        ItemReader          ItemProcessor       ItemWriter
    for each chunk:         |                     |                 |
                          read()                  |                 |
                            |--------------->  process()            |
                            |                     |------------>  write()
                            |                     |                 |

    The reader is going to read until a chunk limit. So typically you configure a chunk size.
    For example, you plan to process 1000 records. Then the ItemProcessor process those 1000 records,
    and then the writer writes them. This process is repeated until the input is exhausted.

        JobLauncher ------- Job ------ Step ------|------ ItemReader
              |______________|___________|        |------ ItemProcessor
                             |                    |------ ItemWriter
                         JobRepository

    Spring Batch uses Map based repository or JDBC based repository.
    If we don't specify the resource, Spring Batch will use an in-memory repository (a Map based one)

               Listeners

    Listeners functionality is implemented by implementing an appropriate interface and than adding the implementation
    to jobs and steps. Each of the interfaces also has a Support Class (for simplification).

        1. JobExecutionListener - which provides before and after job listeners

        2. StepExecutionListener - which provides before and after step capabilities

        3. ChunkListener - which provides before and after chunk as well as onError

        4. ItemReadListener

        5. ItemProcessListener

        6. ItemWriteListener

            (these all are provide before and after each items interaction with an appropriate component)

                Listener Annotations

    Annotations allows you write POJOs instead of implementing Spring Batch interfaces

    @BeforeStep, @AfterStep, @BeforeJob, @AfterJob ... etc.
